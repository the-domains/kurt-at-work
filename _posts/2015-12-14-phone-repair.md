# Phone Repair
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/da9e2b2b-42c3-4bad-b693-8bbb5f1441bc.jpg)

I fix phones.

I'm currently stocked up with all essential parts for glass repair on most Samsung Galaxy and Samsung Note devices and have iPhone display assemblies on the way.

I also repair LG, Motorola, HTC, Sony, Nokia, BlackBerry, and Google phones, but may need to special order parts as repairs come in for those devices.

If you have a broken screen on your device and are tired of looking at it and cutting your fingers, let me know what device you have and what needs to be fixed, I'll give you a quote and I'll get it fixed.
